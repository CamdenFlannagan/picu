picu, a Planner I Can Use, was developed to keep my work organized in a way that makes sense to me
# Next Thursday Time
The picu planner expresses due dates in the **Next Thursday** time format, a formal way of expressing relative time phrases such as "Next Thursday," or "Monday 3 weeks from now."

- "1 Thurs" translates to "the Thursday 1 week after the current week"
- "3 Mon" translates to "the Monday 3 weeks after the current week"
- "0 Tues" translates to "the Tuesday of the current week"
- "-1 Fri" translates to "the Friday 1 week before the current week"

The Next Thursday format makes it clear how long it is until work is due, as it skips the messy and unintuitive arithmetic of Calender time
